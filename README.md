# vue-boilerplate
## Synopsis
Boilerplate for a Vue app.

There are lots of boilerplate projects out there. I find that they are usually either too thin for what I want or have too much clutter. Here I attempt to strike a balance between those two extremes. Note that this project is intentionally bereft of styling. I recommend finding a component library to use with your project.

## Usage
### Get started
To get started:
```
  git clone https://github.com/joncass/vue-boilerplate
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
then visit `localhost:4000` in your browser.

Other useful scripts:
- `yarn test` - Run all tests (linting, unit, end-to-end).

### Make it yours
To make it yours:
- Write your own `README.md`
- Change the name, description, author, and version in `package.json`
- Change the title in `src/build/config.js`
- Replace the copyright in the `LICENSE`
- Put your favicon at `static/favicon.ico`
